## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This SRS describes all specifications for **"Work2Gether"**. It will be an App for mobile usage. "Work2Play" allows
users to manage their Tasks with ease and reward themselfes with freetime activities. Also they should be able to share their Tasks with roommates and other people.
"Work2Play" will be explained. Furthermore reliability, reaction speed and other important
characteristics of this project will be specified. This includes design and architectural decisions regarding optimization of
these criteria as well.

### 1.2 Scope

### 1.5 Overview
The next chapters are about our vision, the product specifications and licensing.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision
With Work2Play you are able to create a To Do list to schedule tasks of your every day life. For each completed tasks you can earn credits. You can use these credits to reward yourself by „buying“ free time for activities you enjoy.

If you have assignments with a deadline or repeating events you could plan them in a calendar and set a date and time to get an early reminder.

In addition to that, it is possible to share tasks with your friends or roommates to work on projects simultaneously.
